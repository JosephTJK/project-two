### Check-in 2
 We researched the header and banner and discussed different ideas. We considered SimpleColors as an alternative for CSS. Below are resources we found useful:
 
#header_wrap {
          color: var(
            --self-check-heading-text,
            var(--simple-colors-default-theme-grey-1, #fff)
          );

 background-color: var(
            --self-check-heading-color,
            var(--simple-colors-default-theme-accent-8, #444)
          );
